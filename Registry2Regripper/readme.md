#### Registry2Ripper Enscript
Verson: 20181214<br>
This script will export registry files into a destined folder and then use Regripper to parse the registry files.

1. Need to do selection in EnCase on the files
  * The reason being that we can speed up the process, instead of parsing every single files.
